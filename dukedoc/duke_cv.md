### Summary

With over 10 years of experience writing and producing technical documentation 
for a wide variety of audiences, I am comfortable working across teams and 
coordinating efforts to get the job done. I like to dig up the details and 
organize them into a coherent whole. I do my best to advocate for the customer 
and strive to make improvements. I am comfortable working from the command line 
and GUI interfaces. I am eager to learn technologies and able to get up to speed 
quickly, prioritize tasks, and meet tight deadlines.
